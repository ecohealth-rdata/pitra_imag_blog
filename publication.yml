- abstract: Excessive fetal growth is associated with DNA methylation
alterations in human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC),
but their functional impact remains elusive. We implemented an
integrative analysis combining single-cell epigenomics, single-cell
transcriptomics, and in vitro analyses to functionally link DNA
methylation changes to putative alterations of HSPC functions. We
showed in hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) from large for gestational
age neonates that both DNA hypermethylation and chromatin
rearrangements target a specific network of transcription factors
known to sustain stem cell quiescence. In parallel, we found a
decreased expression of key genes regulating HSC differentiation
including EGR1, KLF2, SOCS3, and JUNB. Our functional analyses
showed that this epigenetic programming was associated with a
decreased ability for HSCs to remain quiescent. Taken together, our
multimodal approach using single-cell (epi)genomics showed that
human fetal overgrowth affects hematopoietic stem cells' quiescence
    signaling via epigenetic programming.
